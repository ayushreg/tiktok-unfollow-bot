# tiktok-unfollow-bot
This bot can be used to unfollow people who do not follow you back. On TikTok, when someone you follow also follows you, you are considered “friends.” This bot will automatically unfollow anyone who is not a friend. The code can also be easily modified to unfollow everyone in your following list if you want it to.
